# Geometry Files for Doped Organic Dyes

This repository contains molecular geometries in `*.xyz` format for **newly designed doped organic dyes**.  
These structures were used for electronic structure analysis and excited-state calculations in our study on frontier orbital modulation for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

The geometries correspond to systematically doped organic dye molecules and serve as the structural input for all computational analyses reported in the associated manuscript.
