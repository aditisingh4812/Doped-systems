# Geometry Files for Doped Organic Dyes

This repository contains molecular geometries in `*.xyz` format for **newly designed doped organic dyes**.  
These structures were used for electronic structure analysis and excited-state calculations in our study on frontier orbital modulation for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

The geometries correspond to systematically doped organic dye molecules and serve as the structural input for all computational analyses reported in the associated manuscript.

## File Format

- All geometry files are provided in standard **XYZ format**
- Each file corresponds to a unique doped dye configuration

## Notes

These geometries are intended for use in:
- DFT and TDDFT calculations  
- Frontier orbital analysis  
- Charge-transfer and excitation studies  
- DSSC-related computational screening
